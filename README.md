# Diamond programming language

- A super simple programming language based on BASIC.
- Written in python.

# IMPORTANT

- This language is in early development, and currently is only available in the console.
- This is not a good programming language, nor is it better then BASIC, It was made for learning purposes, not for production code.
- Steps to run coming when the language is complete, for now this repository is made to store the code.
